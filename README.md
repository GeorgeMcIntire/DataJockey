Hi! My name is George McIntire aka Jaage, I'm a data scientist by day and DJ by night. 

I would to like present a passion project of mine that combines my two professions: Data Jockey. This project applies my data science expertise towards analyzing my collection of songs. With machine learning's increasing ability to process, synthesize, and even generate music, I became  inspired to dive in and see if big data algorithms could help me better understand my musical oeuvre and perhaps optimize my routine DJ activities.

### Project Overview

"Data Jockey" is a comprehensive and ongoing project that incorporates a wide variety of data tools and methodologies. I've been working on it in a part-time capacity since September 2022 and I am finally ready to publish the first stage of the project. 

At the core of the project is [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/), an "open-source library and tools for audio and music analysis, description and synthesis." I used to Essentia to process, extract data from, and classify the 4000 songs in my collection. I would like to express my gratitude to their team  for making this project happen.

This repo holds the on-going analyses I conduct on the data extracted from Essentia's algorithms and models. The Notebooks directory contains a collection of annotated jupyter notebooks in which I narrate my data handling and analysis. I also uploaded a package I created for my project utility functions.

#### Methodologies?



 - Data

### Project Set up
Steps to set up the environment and packaging I used for the project:

- `conda create -n music python=3.7`

- `conda activate music`

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Install project tools package

- `pip install -e .`
